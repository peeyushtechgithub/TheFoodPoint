# TheFoodPoint
# This purpose of this device is for people with one arm to be able to season their food without the help of others and can be done easily while they are preparing food in the kitchen. Currently the process is very time consuming and somewhat hard to accomplish for people with one arm.
# Currently large foods like the ones listed above are very difficult for users who are one handed to cut/eat. Having a limit on the type of food someone is able to eat should not restrict their ability to enjoy such food. Which is why having a way to to cut these foods easily is an important piece of equipment to have for these individuals in the kitchen.
